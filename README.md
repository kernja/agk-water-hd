# WATER HD

Written in App Game Kit Classic (v1.89), WATER HD was inspired by the DOS puzzle game [H2O](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zf-pR9MNmMI). Although incomplete, WATER HD boasts several improvements over its predecessor [WATER](https://www.github.com/kernja/water):

* Language select
* Supports multiple device sizes and orientations
* Graphical improvements
* Players can interact with the environment while water is flowing
* Players can now draw on the playfield
* Players can zoom in and out on mobile devices
